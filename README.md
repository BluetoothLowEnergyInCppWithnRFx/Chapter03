# Bluetooth Low Energy in C++ with nRF Microcontrollers

## Chapter 3: Bootstrapping


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy in C++ with nRF Microcontrollers_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using Arduino 101.

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Turn on the Bluetooth Radio
* Peripheral: Turn on the Bluetooth Radio
